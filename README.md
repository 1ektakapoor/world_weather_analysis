# World Weather Analysis

Adding a few changes to the PlanMyTrip app, an app created for customers to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences. 

The app now retrieves the weather description for weather data where the beta testers can input statements to filter for their weather preferences. This input will then be used to a create subset of data which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta testers will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Where the app will use Google Maps Directions API, to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
